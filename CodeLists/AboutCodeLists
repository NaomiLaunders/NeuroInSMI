These code lists include the Read codes only, which can be mapped to CPRD medcodes using the CPRD dictionary. Alternatively, they can be provided on request. 

Code lists were generated in CPRD. They are specific to CPRD and to the exact database builds. When re-using codelists it's advisable to search for new terms in the system being used.

The medcode and medcodeid fields used by CPRD must be kept as character vectors so that they do not get truncated. Stata, R and Excel all truncate these values if stored as numeric. Some code lists undergo additional post-processing to select the variables of interest.
